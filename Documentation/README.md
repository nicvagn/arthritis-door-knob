<!--- Open Source Assistive Technology Template: GitHub Documents Readme Verson 1.2 (2025-Feb-04)  --->
This folder contains copies of the documentation in an easily shareable/viewable format (e.g., .pdf, .csv). The Working_Documents subfolder contains the primary versions of the documentation in an easily editable format. Updated versions of the shareable documents should be created when the design is released and after substantial changes and the older versions should be deleted.

The filenames of documentation in this folder should remain the same so that any links to the documentation remain valid. (e.g., OpenAT_Device_Maker_Guide.pdf).
