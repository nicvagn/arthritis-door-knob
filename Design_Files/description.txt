    So this is an arthritis door handle I designed and built for m wright <saskie8@hotmail.com>. I don't remember her last name.

All the design documents are here and a picture of the device on my door nob. Here door nob is bigger, thus it will not fit on mine.

I designed an built it, and do not know how to report it.
